![Build status](https://github.com/joonas-fi/tamperewebcam/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Takes (and crops) image from one of the camera feeds in my hometown and makes it available
at a stable URL and archives the images for me to maybe make automated timelapse videos later.

Runs in AWS Lambda


Published image at
------------------

https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.function61.com/tampere-webcam/hiedanranta/latest.jpg

I show this URL in my constantly-on info display at home.


Why is this open source?
------------------------

This can't directly benefit anyone, as there are many hardcoded details. But I open sourced
this because there might be some details that could help someone:

- Roundshot (the provider that has multiple 360Â° cameras in my city) URL making
- Image cropping
- S3 bucket access, incl. copying
- Lambda function, hybrid one (can directly run locally but also in Lambda)
- Dead man's switch check-in to an alerting system
  * So that if this stops working, I get an alert


Cropping
--------

Here's how the original image is cropped:
